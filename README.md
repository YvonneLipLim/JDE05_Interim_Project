- Project Objectives:
  - Use Python to develop a crawler using public APIs
  - Explore appropriate open-source libraries

  - Apply SQL in Python to insert, update and review the crawled data in the database
- Evaluation Rubric:
  - Research & Analysis
  - Project Goal
  - Design & Development
  - Prototyping
  - Presentation (all members will need to present the project)


### What Are Our Challenges?
Yvonne's Findings 19/11/2024:
1. Sourcing of FREE APIs; most travel sites are not open source, only available to Affiliates or pay subscriptions.
2. The developer documentation is quite hard to understand, and the JSON scripts are unable to be linked into the Python environment well.
3. Available open source APIs: Data.gov, Pokemon & OpenWeatherMap (tested successfully)


### What Are The Recommendations?
Yvonne's Suggestions 19/11/2024:
1. Drop the original plan and select a much more appropriate open-source API to deliver the project given the challenge.
