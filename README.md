# JDE05_Interim_Project
Generation SG Junior Data Engineer Programme Interim Project 


### When To Complete the Interim Project?
- Timeline: Wed, 4th Dec 2024
- Topic: Travel Trends, Flight Cost Analysis
- Project Objectives:
  - Use Python to develop a crawler using public APIs
  - Explore appropriate open-source libraries
  - Install PostgreSQL or SQL server to design database schema, tables and entity-relationship model(s)
  - Apply SQL in Python to insert, update and review the crawled data in the database
- Evaluation Rubric:
  - Research & Analysis
  - Project Goal
  - Design & Development
  - Prototyping
  - Presentation (all members will need to present the project)


### What Are Our Challenges?
Yvonne's Findings 19/11/2024:
1. Sourcing of FREE APIs; most travel sites are not open source, only available to Affiliates or pay subscriptions.
2. The developer documentation is quite hard to understand, and the JSON scripts are unable to be linked into the Python environment well.
3. Available open source APIs: Data.gov, Pokemon & OpenWeatherMap (tested successfully)


### What Are The Recommendations?
Yvonne's Suggestions 19/11/2024:
1. Carefully consider the project requirements and choose the APIs that best meet our needs given the challenge on the API source _https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/public-apis-for-developers/_ so that we could focus more time on the database schema, remodify the Python scripts to apply SQL and create presentation deck.
