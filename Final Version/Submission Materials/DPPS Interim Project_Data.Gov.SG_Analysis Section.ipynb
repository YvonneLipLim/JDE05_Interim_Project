    "\n",
    "In our scenario, the buyer Daniel, would like to search for the coolest area of Singapore to buy his flat, because he does not like hot weather, and also wants to save on electricity bills. As such, we embark on analysis to attempt to answer the above question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "Using 4 SQL Queries, we look to answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where are the coolest HDB towns in Singapore?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the average price of each flat type in the coolest HDB town, over the past 1 year?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With all other factors of the flats being equal, how can I find the blocks with the latest 5 transactions average, which are less than the past 1 year average price? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input final conditions (flat type, remaining lease, storey range), to filter the blocks into a manageable number for searching on propertyguru.com and finally, viewings!"
